Welcome to our submission for the EthWarsaw 2024 hackathon

This is our virtual conference hall featuring some of your esteemed sponsors

To run this you will need to use both the web client and the web server
https://github.com/futureismeta/eth-warsaw-server
https://github.com/futureismeta/eth-warsaw-frontend

It is suggested you put both projects in the same directory, and save the eth-warsaw-frontend as web-client (sorry)

Once you have both projects in the same directory, please run the following commands:

in the web server `yarn build && yarn start`

in the web client `yarn vite`

The web client will be running on http://localhost:3000 - follow it and explore!

WASD to move (not arrow keys)
